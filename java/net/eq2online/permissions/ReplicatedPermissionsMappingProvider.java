/**
 * In the replicated permissions model, client permissions are mapped to bukkit
 * permissions by permissions mapping providers. This interface defines classes
 * which are able to map replicated client permissions to bukkit permissions. The
 * idea here is that if a client mod requires special behaviour in terms of
 * mapping requested permissions to real permissions, it can be implemented as a
 * permissions provider.
 * 
 * The default implementation {@link PermissionsMappingProviderGeneric} is used
 * to provide a 1-to-1 mapping of permissions, and is configurable to support any
 * client mod. If no special behaviour is required, the generic provider can be
 * used and can be easily configured by server admins to support any mod required.
